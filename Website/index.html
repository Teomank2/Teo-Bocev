                <p class="Origins-text-1">Born in Geneva, Rodolphe Töpffer had completely different goals in life when he was young. His father 
                    (Wolfgang Adam Töpffer) was a famous painter who started off poor, but climbed up the upper ranks od sociery with his skill.
                    His dream was to live up to his father's progress, begining to paint from as early as possible. Shortly after applying to the
                    same art-school like his father in Paris at the ripe age of 20, Rodolphe starts losing his eyesight. It worsened to the point 
                    that he had to drop out of school and go back to Geneva. To make money, he opens up a boarding school for young boys. To 
                    amuse them, he used his artistic skills and drew doodles for them, Making characters and putting them in silly stories. this
                    time waster for Rodolph spurted the seed of a new medium that would later be known as a comic (book).</p> 
                    <p class="Origins-text-2" > However, at the time, 
                    even though it was popular, artstyles like caricature was not nearly as respected as realism was, so 
                    Rodolphe wouldn't dare to publish them or show them to people who weren't his students or people were close to him until way later
                    on with the help of Johann Wolfgang Von Goethe. Johan, like other famous artists, was depressed because of the french revolution,
                    so one of his friends, who was a friend of Rodolph,  kept bringing him his comic which brought a smile to his face. With his encouragement,
                    Rodolphe overcomes his fear and manages to publish his first work! Although the critics tear him apart and by the time he published it, Johann
                    had passed away, the public loves it so it becomes a huge hit, encouraging him to make more comics.

                        The company began life as "Timely Publications" in 1939, with comic books featuring Captain America, Namor the Sub-Mariner and an early version of Human Torch. Legendary comics writer Stan Lee was hired as an office assistant in 1939. Within two years, the 19-year-old Lee was promoted to editor of the Marvel Comics line, a post that he would keep until 1972.
Everything changed in 1961, when Stan Lee and artist Jack Kirby ushered in "The Marvel Age of Comics" by creating The Fantastic Four which brought a new style of superhero comic that focused on the characters' internal drama as well as their heroic adventures. The style was a huge success, and the Lee/Kirby team went on to create the Incredible Hulk, Iron Man, the Mighty Thor, the X-Men, the Avengers, and the Inhumans. The prolific Lee worked with artist Steve Ditko to create Marvel's greatest success story, Spider-Man. Stan Lee's Marvel revolution extended beyond the characters and storylines to the way in which comic books engaged the readership and built a sense of community between fans and creators.

                        There are two types of people: People who do art and people who don't because 
                        they think they can't. It is one of the most subjective topic anywhere in world,
                        it's just another skill that anyone can practice, and yet we assume that 
                        we don't have a permission to have fun with creating something without being talented. Why is that?
                        Go ahead, make a fun story, make a terrible one, use pretty fonts, use ugly ones like the one I chose 
                        in the intro just because I felt like it. And you know what? I liked how It came out and I had fun!
